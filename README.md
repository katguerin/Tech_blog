# Tech_blog
module 14 MVC hw

# AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions

## Includes:
- express-handlebars (to use Handlebars.js for your Views)
- sequelize (to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers)
- dontenv package (to use environment variables)
- bcrypt package (to hash passwords)
- express-session &
- (does not) connect-session-sequelize (packages to add authentication)
- Application must be deployed to Heroku

## This might work if I had also done Module 13
